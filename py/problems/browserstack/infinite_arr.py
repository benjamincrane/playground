Complexity Analysis -

Intuition of algorithm:
naive algorithm is O(N). O(logN) can be acheived using binary search if the size is known.
For unknown sized array the intuition of binary search can be used.
The basic approach expands the search scope by doubling the scope
(as apposed to b-search approach of cutting scope down by 1/2).
So the approach is inspired by binary search and tries to acheive similar runtime

Formal analysis:
partition is a recursive procedure. The size of the array decreases by 1/2 for each recursive call.
At each level of recursion there log N iterations
where N is number of 1's in top level call
then N/2 in 1st recursive call and N/4 in 2nd  recursive calland so on

So
T(N) = log2(N) + log2(N/2) + log2(N/4) + .... log(16) + log(8) + log(4) + log(2) + log(1) 

     *****WRONG ANALYSIS*****
     dropping the lower order terms we get
     
      ----------------
     | T(N) = O(logN) | - This was my earlier hand waving kind of analysis
      ----------------
     
*****CORRECT ONE******

T(N) = log2(N) + log2(N/2) + log(N/4) ..... + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0
       this is sum of series [formula: m(m+1)/2]
     = log(N) * (log(N)+1)/2
     = (log(N)^2)/2+ log(N)/2

Now dropping the lower order terms and constants we get

 ----------------
| T(N) = O(log^2N) | - Order log-square-N
 ----------------
