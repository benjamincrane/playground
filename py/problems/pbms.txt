Challenge 2: Hill

Given an array of integer elements

Your task is to

    write a function that finds the minimum value X that makes possible the following: generate a new array that is sorted in strictly ascending order by increasing or decreasing each of the elements of the initial array with integer values in the [0, X] range.
        Example: Having the initial array [5, 4, 3, 2, 8] the minimum value for X is 3. Decrease the first element (5) by 3, decrease the second one (4) by 1, increase the third one (3) by 1, increase the forth one (2) by 3 and do nothing to the last one (8). In the end we obtain the array [2, 3, 4, 5, 8] which is sorted in strictly ascending order.
    print the result X to the standard output (stdout)

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

    v
        which is the array of integers

Data constraints

    numbers are in ascending order when arranged from the smallest to the largest number
    strictly ascending order means that each element is greater than the preceding one (e.g. [1, 2, 2, 3] is NOT strictly ascending order)
    the length of the array will not exceed 5000
    the elements of any of the arrays are integer numbers in the [1, 231 -1] range

Efficiency constraints

    your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds

Example
Input 	Output

v: 5, 4, 3, 2, 8

Challenge 3: City Roads

You are living in a country with N cities. Each city is identified by an unique integer ID in the [1..N] range. The cities are connected by M bidirectional roads. All the roads have the same length.

Given the ID of your home city and the ID of a destination city

Your task is to

    write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the minimum number of roads you need to travel in order to reach the destination city.
    the destination city will always be accessible from your home city.

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

    N
        which is an integer number giving the number of cities
    home_city
        which is an integer number giving the ID of your home city
    dest_city
        which is an integer number giving the ID of the destination city
    firstCityRoads
        which is an array of integers giving the ID of the first city connected by each road
    secondCityRoads
        which is an array of integers giving the ID of the second city connected by each road

The ith road connects the ith city in the firstCityRoad array and the ith city in the secondCityRoad array.

Data constraints

    the number of cities will not exceed 5000
    the number of roads will not exceed 100000

Efficiency constraints

    your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds

Example
Input 	Output

N: 7
home_city: 1
dest_city: 4
firstCityRoads: [1, 2, 3, 2, 5]
secondCityRoads: [3, 3, 4, 4, 6]

Challenge 4: Maximum Difference

Given an array of integer elements, a subsequence of this array is a set of consecutive elements from the array (i.e: given the array v: [7, 8, -3, 5, -1], a subsequence of v is 8, -3, 5)

Your task is to

    write a function that finds a left and a right subsequence of the array that satisfy the following conditions
        the two subsequences are unique (they don't have shared elements)
        the difference between the sum of the elements in the right subsequence and the sum of the elements in the left subsequence is maximum
    print the difference to the standard output (stdout)

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

    v
        which is the array of integers

Data constraints

    the array has at least 2 and at most 1,000,000 numbers
    all the elements in the array are integer numbers in the following range: [-1000, 1000]

Efficiency constraints

    your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds

Example
Input 	Output

v: 3, -5, 1, -2, 8, -2, 3, -2, 1
	

15

Explanation

The left sequence is : -5, 1, -2 and the right sequence is: 8, -2, 3.

Challenge 5: Order Task

You are given a set of tasks which are uniquely identified by integer IDs and a set of dependencies that define which tasks must be executed prior to others.

Your task is to

    write a function that orders the tasks so that all dependencies are satisfied
    print to the standard output (stdout) all ordered task IDs separated by a white space (on a single line)

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

    dependencyFirst
        which is an array of integers giving the ID of the task that needs to be executed first in each dependency
    dependencySecond
        which is an array of integers giving the ID of the task that needs to be executed second in each dependency
    totalNumTasks
        which is an integer value giving the total number of tasks in the set

The ith dependency is described as follows: the ith task in dependencyFirst must be executed prior to the ith task in dependencySecond.

Data constraints

    the number of tasks in each collection will not be higher than 10,000
    within a collection of N tasks all the IDs are integers in the [1,N] range
    for a given set of tasks there may be multiple ways of ordering it to satisfy the dependencies and any of them is accepted as a correct solution

Efficiency constraints

    your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds

Example
Input 	Output

dependencyFirst: 3, 1, 2
dependencySecond: 2, 2, 4
num_total_tasks: 6
	

3 1 5 2 4 6

Explanation

    The set contains 6 tasks and they will be identified by IDs=1,2,3,4,5,6
    Task 3 must be executed prior to task 2, task 1 must be executed prior to task 2 and task 2 must be executed prior to task 4
    One order that satisfies the three dependencies is: 3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6
